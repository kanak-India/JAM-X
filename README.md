📋 Quick StartNavigate to Option 3 (Help) and select Option 1 to install all dependencies.Go to Option 2 to start the scanner.Wait for your target to appear and press Ctrl+C.Enter the ID and select your attack method.2. The User Manual (MANUAL.md)This document provides the technical details on how to use the tool correctly.📖 JAM-X User Manual🛠 PrerequisitesOS: Kali Linux, Parrot OS, or Ubuntu.Hardware: An external Bluetooth adapter (e.g., CSR 4.0 or Sena UD100) is highly recommended for hci1 stability.Permissions: Root/Sudo access is mandatory for raw socket manipulation.🎮 Menu Options Explained1. Know Your BluetoothDisplays local adapter details.Status: Must be ONLINE to perform attacks.MAC Address: Your local hardware ID (helps avoid self-targeting).2. Continuous ScanThis is the core of JAM-X. It uses hcitool and btmgmt in a background loop.Power (%): Indicates signal strength. 90%+ means the target is very close.Ctrl+C: This does not exit the script; it pauses the scan so you can select a target MAC.3. Attack Methods (The Tactical Suite)MethodTarget TypeTechnical ActionExpected ResultBlueSmackAudio/HIDL2CAP Buffer OverflowAudio stutter or mouse lag.Conn FloodSmartphonesAuthentication SpamsPairing pop-up loops and UI lag.SDP FuzzingIoT/Smart TVService Query LoopService becomes unavailable.Force DCEarphonesLink-Layer HijackingDisconnects earbuds from mobile.⚠️ TroubleshootingAdapter Not Found: If hci1 is missing, check hcitool dev. You can change the INTERFACE variable in the script header if your card is hci0.Scan is Blank: Ensure the target device is in Pairing Mode or Discoverable Mode.Attack not working: Ensure you are physically close to the target (within 5-10 meters).⚖️ Legal WarningJAM-X is intended for legal authorized pentesting only. Do not use this tool on devices you do not own or have written permission to test.
